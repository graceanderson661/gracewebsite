The main point of the website I am creating is to act as a portfolio for my work. I will have previous projects including projects from this class, design page spread examples, and written work. I want to have a section for my resume and where to contact me. I have a link to my linked in profile to allow employers to easily find and contact me. Overall I want the site to be simple and easy to navigate.
